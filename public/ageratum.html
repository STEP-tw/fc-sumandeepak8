              Ageratum (/əˈdʒɛrətəm/),[2] (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical and warm temperate
              flow- ering annuals and perennials from the family Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native
              to Central America and Mexico but four are native to the United States.[3]<br><br>
              They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The opposite leaves are cordate or
              oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters.<br><br><br>
              The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and spread in small compound umbels. They
              give small, dry fruits.<br><br>
